Hello,
<br /><br />
My name is Greg Khachaturyan. I am interested in an open position with your company.

<br /><br />
I have experience in both software development and IT. I've built web applications and content management systems and provided IT support for 40+ employees. I am an organized and efficient problem solver with sharp critical thinking skills and strong ambitions. I am a good multi-tasker adept at managing many requests, and I provide good feedback and regular communication.

<br /><br />
I have experience in several programming languages, including: (Python, PHP, Javascript, C, C++ and Java). I have experience deploying and troubleshooting Windows (7/Vista/XP), Mac (10.7/6/5) and Linux operating systems (Ubuntu/Debian/RedHat/CentOS). I have built several websites and web applications and content management systems and have experience developing in the Flask Python Web Application Framework as well CakePHP. I have experience with the Agile development philosophy and have worked with a team that adhered to Scrum and Kanban. I believe in code cleanliness and clarity and the importance of comments and good documentation. 

<br /><br />
I am comfortable working with the Linux command line and have experience working in a pure command line environment. I can set up and configure a web server and have experience configuring Apache and Mod_WSGI on CentOS, Debian and Ubuntu servers. I have worked with such tools as 
dd, fdisk, gparted, and the PartImage ghost imaging tool and performed hard drive diagnostics. I have managed data migration between servers and have experience working in a server room replacing UPS devices and rack-mounting servers. I am comfortable using a toning wand to track down and troubleshoot Ethernet networks and have a good understanding of networking theory and principals.

<br /><br />
Feel free to call me anytime at (213)-375-8962. 
I've included my resume in the body of this email below.

<br /><br />
Thanks
