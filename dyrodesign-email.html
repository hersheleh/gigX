Hello,
<br/><br/>
My name is Stan Dyro. I am interested in the open position with your company. I think I'd be a great match.

<br/><br/>
I am intelligent, articulate, professional, personable, and I have worked in many different facets of tech: advertising, web development, and the film business. I am fluent across Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux and have done development in jQuery / HTMl / CSS and am currently working on serveral projects in Python, node.js, and PHP. I have had held positions such as Assistant IT Manager, Production Coordinator, and Technical Specialist.

<br/><br/>
I am an efficient multi-tasker, have technical and life experience in wide range of fields and disciplines and I am an experienced and adept software and hardware troubleshooter-- having worked IT in time-sensitive highly demanding fields such as advertising and film production. I have a strong background in help-desk and technical support and I am fluent across Windows 7, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms inside and out.  Deployment of systems and repair is no problem. I also have command lind BASH scripting experience and web development experience with PHP, MySQL, and Javascript.

<br/><br/>
I am also deeply familiar with the ins and outs of Microsoft Office in corporate environments (particularly Outlook, Word, Excel) and industry standard accounting and database programs (SQL, Access, Quickbooks, etc) in addition to graphic design and web with Adobe CS5.

<br/><br/>
Feel free to give me a call anytime 310.936.9993. I've also included my resumé in the body of the email below.
